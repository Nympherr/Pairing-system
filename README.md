# Round-robin-generator
**What this program does:**

It is a round robin generator (mainly for chess) where a user can select a number of people and the program will automatically generate the pairings. Every player will get the same amount of "white" and "black" if the number of players is odd. If the number of players is even then someone will get an extra "white" or "black". This was done for my University's algorithms and data structures course.

**How to use it:**

Have all the files in the folder and open index.html in the browser

**What have I learnt by doing this project:**

1) Learnt how round-robin tournaments are generated
2) Struggled a lot making that every player would get same "white" and "black" colors. Looking back, it was not that difficult
3) Remembered a bit javascript,html,css. It was quite a long time since I used it
